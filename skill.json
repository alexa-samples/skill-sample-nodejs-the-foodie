When the user invokes the skill for the first time it asks a series of questions, one at a time, designed to help the user determine what it is they should eat. As it does so, The Foodie remembers the answers to certain questions (like what allergies the user has) so that the next time it runs, it can avoid asking them again. Over time, the skill learns about the user's preferences and habits, making it more accurate in its recipe and restaurant recommendations."
